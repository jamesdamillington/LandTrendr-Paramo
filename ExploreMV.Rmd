> The FIRMS fire data (MODIS C6 & VIIRS) for 20 Jan 2012 (date VIIRS data became available from) to 30 Nov 2019 can be found at: `Data/URLs/REF2`

> There are separate zip folders for MODIS and VIIRS. Note also, though the data is shp, there were options for outputs as csvs or jsons. I used the same extent as I’ve been running for LandTrendr (covering all the Páramos of Boyacá).
